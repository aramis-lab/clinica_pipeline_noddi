This repository contains the NODDI pipeline and preprocessing pipeline for multi-shell data used for the paper "Neurite density is reduced in the presymptomatic phase of C9orf72 disease".

These pipelines need the [Clinica software platform](http://www.clinica.run) that you will have to install.

If you use these pipelines, please cite:
